# MTN Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data for MTN to understand why customers leave and identify key churn drivers.

## Objectives
- Identify churn patterns
- Analyze customer behavior
- Provide recommendations to reduce churn

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Power BI
- SQL

## Key Insights
- Customers with high call drop rates are more likely to churn
- Contract type strongly affects retention
- Long-term customers have lower churn rates
-  Early-tenure customers and specific age bands are the most vulnerable
   segments to target for retention
- Churn level: ~29% of customers are churning.
 - Revenue at risk: Churned customers account for tens of millions in lost
   revenue; even a small decrease in churn will pay off meaningfully.
 -Shorter-tenure customers (onboarded within the last ~2 years). 
-Certain age brackets (especially working-age adults, judging by the age‑range
 chart). 
- Why they leave:
 Perceived high prices (call tariffs, data plans). 
 Better offers from competitors (promos, bundles). 
 Poor network quality and customer service.

## Recommendations
- Improve network quality
- Offer loyalty incentives to long-term users
- Target high-risk customers with retention campaigns
- Create value bundles that neutralize the “better offers from competitors”
 complaint for key subscription plans (e.g., the most popular monthly plans in
 the data).
-Since 0–6 and 13–24 month customers churn more: Introduce bonus data for low‑usage customers, Personalized offers for high‑spend customers,
 Proactive customer care outreach where satisfaction is low.
 -For states and locations (using State, lattitude, longtitude) with high
 churn and “Poor Network” as a reason: Prioritize network optimization projects (coverage, throughput).
